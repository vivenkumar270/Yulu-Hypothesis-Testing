# Yulu-Hypothesis-Testing
Predict demand for Yulu's electric cycles in India.  Analyze data to identify key factors (weather, user type) &amp; build model (exploratory) to forecast demand. Optimize pricing, target marketing &amp; allocate resources for Yulu's growth .

Key Objectives:

    Identify and quantify the significant variables impacting electric cycle rental demand (e.g., weather, user type, day type, temperature).
    Employ statistical techniques like bi-variate analysis, hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square), and potentially model building (ANN, regression) to uncover these relationships.
    Translate findings into actionable insights for Yulu, including:
        Optimized pricing strategies based on demand fluctuations.
        Targeted marketing campaigns to attract specific user segments.
        Strategic resource allocation to ensure sufficient cycles in high-demand areas during peak hours.
